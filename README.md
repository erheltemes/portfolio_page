# portfolio_page

## general layout
portfolio includes 2 pages - the home page and contact page

## home page
* includes about me, links to work samples, link to contact page, and link to resume
* work samples can be added in js and automatically propagate on page load

## Contact page
* includes link to github and linkedIn as well as phone number
* form will is just a placeholder but will shortly have javascript which will take user's email address and send me an eamil. I would also like an API that checks the the user is human.
